## âœ… Batch Tag Editing: Production-Ready (2024-06)
- Batch tag add, remove, and clear actions are fully implemented and robust in both backend and frontend.
- The batch action bar UI is reliable, immediate, and accessible for all tag changes.
- Automated tests for batch tag actions are present and passing (see `tests/test_batch_tag.py`).
- The test suite uses a production-matching schema and covers all batch tag actions for multiple clips.
- The batch tag workflow is now fully production-ready and tested as of this commit.

### ðŸš€ Web-Based Migration Plan (2024-06)

- [ ] **Migrate LoopSleuth to a web-based frontend for a modern, rich UX.**
    - [x] Decision: Move from TUI to web UI for better media interaction, tagging, and extensibility.
    - [ ] Scaffold a new web app (FastAPI preferred, Flask as fallback).
    - [ ] Reuse existing backend/database logic for clips, tags, starring, export, etc.
    - [ ] Implement grid view of clips with thumbnails (HTML/CSS, responsive).
    - [ ] Add video playback page/modal (HTML5 `<video>` tag).
    - [ ] Add tagging, starring, and export features in the web UI.
    - [ ] Implement search/filtering and batch actions.
    - [ ] (Optional) Add duplicate detection, advanced metadata, and creative integrations.
    - [ ] Document migration and update README.
    - [x] Unify tag/star JS logic in a shared static file and include in both grid and detail templates.
- [ ] **TUI is now feature-frozen except for critical bugfixes.**

### MVP checklist (handâ€‘curated)

- [ ] cli.py: Typer entry â€‘â€‘scan/â€‘â€‘ui/â€‘â€‘export
- [ ] ingest_folder(): tqdm walk, call probe_video(), commit
- [ ] thumbnails: skip if exists & mtime unchanged
- [ ] Textual grid: lazyâ€‘load thumbs (path â†’ Image.open)
- [ ] export_td: write absolute paths, newlineâ€‘delimited

### Tag Autocomplete & Deletion Implementation Plan

#### Tag Autocomplete
- [x] Backend: `/tags` endpoint returns all tag names (already implemented).
- [x] Backend: Add `/tags?q=prefix` endpoint for prefix search (now implemented).
- [x] Frontend: On tag input, fetch suggestions from `/tags` (debounced, filter as user types).
- [x] Frontend: Show dropdown of suggestions below the input.
- [x] Frontend: Allow keyboard/mouse selection of suggestions; on select, add tag chip.
- [x] Testing: Verify with similar prefix tags, new tags, and UX polish (pending user feedback).

#### Tag Deletion (chip X)
- [x] Frontend: Render editable tag chips with X for removal (already implemented in JS, but ensure UX is robust).
- [x] Frontend: On X click, remove tag from input and update chips live.
- [x] Frontend: On save, persist tag removal via AJAX to backend.
- [x] Testing: Remove tags, verify persistence and UI update (pending user feedback).

---

**[2024-06-14] Tag autocomplete and deletion changes committed and pushed. Next step: user testing and UX polish as needed.**

### NEXT: Batch Editing & Filtering (after autocomplete/deletion)
- [x] Design and implement multi-select in grid view.
- [x] Add batch action controls (add/remove tags, star/unstar, delete) UI.
- [x] Batch tag autocomplete to batch bar inputs.
- [x] Batch tag input uses chip-style input with autocomplete, keyboard navigation, and removable chips, matching single-clip edit UX.
- [x] Batch add/remove/clear is fully accessible and visually consistent.
- [x] Batch remove field is now chip-based: chips represent tags present on selected clips, are removable with Ã—, and only chips in the remove field are removed. Autocomplete suggests only tags present on selected clips and not already chips. UX matches single-clip edit for clarity and accessibility.
- [x] Per-clip tag editing in the detail view is now fully consistent with the batch editor (chip-style input, autocomplete, keyboard/ARIA UX). Tag saving is robust and persists to the database.
- [x] Codebase is ready for handoff and onboarding. See STARTUP_MESSAGE.md and README.md for latest state and next steps.
- [x] Backend: Add endpoints for batch tag/star actions and filtering.
- [x] Wire up frontend batch actions to backend.
- [x] Add batch tag autocomplete and polish.
- [x] Testing: Select multiple clips, apply actions, verify DB and UI.

### Troubleshooting
- Batch bar and batch tag autocomplete are working in the UI.
- Backend and DB schema are correct; `/test_tag/{clip_id}` endpoint works with valid JSON.
- Browser AJAX requests for single-clip tag editing are working; batch actions backend integration is next.
- [x] [2024-06-14] Batch bar tag add/remove/autocomplete now robust to DOM state. Toast feedback restored. Selection logic fixed. Batch bar is now resilient to rapid selection/deselection and DOM changes.
