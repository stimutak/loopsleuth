# LoopSleuth

> **Note (2024-06-13): LoopSleuth is now web-first!**
> The web UI (FastAPI + Jinja2) is the primary interface for browsing, tagging, and managing video loops. See `STARTUP_MESSAGE.md` for the latest project state, usage, and next steps.

## üö¶ Handoff & Next Steps (2024-06)
- **Production-ready:**
  - Modern, dark, Cursor-inspired UI with always-visible action and batch bars
  - Batch selection, tagging, export (keepers.txt), and copy-to-folder for selected clips
  - Custom checkboxes, grid scroll restore, robust batch UX
- **Next steps for dev:**
  - Playlist management (create, name, reorder, export playlists)
  - Advanced export (zip, TouchDesigner .tox, etc.)
  - Further UX polish (keyboard shortcuts, accessibility, creative/visual features)
  - Gather user feedback and iterate

A web-first (formerly terminal-first) librarian for video loops.

## Why
- Thumbnail & metadata view for huge DXV/H.264 clip libraries
- ‚≠ê flag keepers, tag with free text, delete duds
- Export a `keepers.txt` list for a TouchDesigner Replicator

## Web UI Modernization (2024-06)
- The UI is being redesigned for a modern, compact, high-contrast look with blue accents (#3fa7ff).
- All cards, bars, and controls are denser, with less padding and smaller text for information-rich browsing.
- A persistent selection bar floats at the bottom, showing selected count and actions (export, copy, clear, playlist coming soon).
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation are maintained.
- Responsive design: grid and controls scale for smaller screens.

## MVP (v0.1)
1. **Scan**: walk folder ‚Üí SQLite row per clip (`ffprobe`)
2. **Thumb**: grab frame @ 25 % duration ‚Üí 256 px JPEG
3. **Hash**: perceptual pHash ‚Üí find near‚Äëdupes later
4. **Web UI**: Grid and detail views for browsing, starring, tagging, selection, and playback
5. **Export**: write `keepers.txt` with starred or selected clip paths

_Stretch_: duplicate‚Äëcollapse, CLIP auto‚Äëtags, .tox export.

## Tech
Python ‚â• 3.10, ffmpeg/ffprobe, SQLite, Pillow, imagehash, FastAPI, Jinja2, Textual, Typer.

### Web UI JavaScript
- All AJAX actions for starring and tag editing are handled by a shared static JS file (`src/loopsleuth/web/static/clip_actions.js`).
- Both the grid and detail views include this file for consistent, maintainable behavior.

### Tag System (vNext)
- Tags are now stored in a normalized schema: a `tags` table (unique tag names) and a `clip_tags` join table (many-to-many: clips <-> tags).
- This enables tag reuse, autocomplete, and efficient tag-based search/filtering.

### Tag Editing UX (2024-06)

- Per-clip tag editing in the detail view is now fully consistent with the batch editor: chip-style input, autocomplete, keyboard navigation, and ARIA/accessibility are all supported. Tag changes are persisted to the database and reflected in both the detail and grid views.
- The codebase is ready for handoff or onboarding. See STARTUP_MESSAGE.md and TODO.md for the latest project state and next steps.

#### Remaining polish for pro-level UX
- [x] ARIA roles/attributes for full screen reader support
- [x] Dropdown scrolls to keep highlight visible (for long lists)
- Batch tag editing (multi-select)
- Tag color/category support (optional)
- Tag reordering (optional)

See code comments for further details and next steps.

## Batch Editing Handoff Checklist

### ‚úÖ What's Implemented
- Batch selection UI: Checkbox, click, shift+click, ctrl/cmd+click for multi/range selection. Visual highlight for selected cards.
- Batch action bar: <div id="batch-action-bar"> present in grid.html template. CSS for floating bar and controls in style.css. JS logic for rendering the bar and handling selection in clip_actions.js.
- Tag editing UI: Add tags, remove tags, clear all tags (UI and backend). Keyboard accessibility and ARIA for tag editing.
- **Batch tag input now uses chip-style input with autocomplete, keyboard navigation, and removable chips, matching the single-clip edit UX.**
- **Batch add/remove/clear is fully accessible and visually consistent.**
- **Batch remove field is now chip-based:** Chips represent tags present on selected clips, are removable with √ó, and only chips in the remove field are removed. Autocomplete suggests only tags present on selected clips and not already chips. UX matches single-clip edit for clarity and accessibility.
- README: Updated with tag editing and batch editing UX, keyboard shortcuts, and accessibility.

### üü° What's NOT Done
- [ ] Batch action bar is not appearing in the UI (likely a CSS/DOM/JS load order issue‚Äîsee below).
- [ ] Backend integration for batch tag add/remove/clear (no /batch_tag endpoint yet).
- [ ] No toast/snackbar feedback after batch operations.
- [ ] No batch tag autocomplete yet (uses plain input for now).

### üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Steps for Next Dev
1. Check if <div id="batch-action-bar"> is present in the DOM (Elements tab in dev tools).
2. Check for [BatchBar] logs or JS errors in the Console.
3. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear browser cache.
4. Check for CSS issues: The bar uses position: fixed; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; z-index: 2000;. If the parent container or body has overflow: hidden or a low z-index, the bar may be hidden.
5. If the bar is present and visible but not interactive, proceed to backend integration and UI polish.

### üö¶ Next Steps
- [ ] Debug and fix batch bar visibility.
- [ ] Implement /batch_tag endpoint in backend.
- [ ] Wire up frontend batch actions to backend.
- [ ] Add feedback (toast/snackbar) after batch actions.
- [ ] Add batch tag autocomplete and polish.

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/loopsleuth.git # Replace with actual URL later
    cd loopsleuth
    ```
2.  **Install FFmpeg:**
    LoopSleuth relies on `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` for video processing. You must install FFmpeg separately. Download it from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
    **Important:** Ensure the `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` executables are available in your system's PATH environment variable. Alternatively, configuration options to specify the paths might be added in the future.
3.  **Set up Python environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    # Activate the environment (Windows PowerShell)
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # Activate the environment (Bash/Zsh)
    # source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- [2024-06-14] Batch bar tag add/remove/autocomplete now robust to DOM state. Toast feedback restored. Selection logic fixed. Batch bar is now resilient to rapid selection/deselection and DOM changes.

## ‚úÖ Batch Tag Editing: Production-Ready (2024-06)
- Batch tag add, remove, and clear actions are fully implemented and robust in both backend and frontend.
- The batch action bar UI is reliable, immediate, and accessible for all tag changes.
- Automated tests for batch tag actions are present and passing (see `tests/test_batch_tag.py`).
- The test suite uses a production-matching schema and covers all batch tag actions for multiple clips.
- The batch tag workflow is now fully production-ready and tested as of this commit.

## üöÄ Playlist Management (2024-06)

LoopSleuth now supports (or is adding) robust playlist management for creative workflows:

- **Database:**
  - `playlists` table: id, name, created_at
  - `playlist_clips` join table: playlist_id, clip_id, position (ordering)
- **Backend API:**
  - Create, rename, delete playlists
  - Add/remove clips (batch)
  - Reorder clips (drag-and-drop or up/down)
  - List playlists and their clips
  - Export playlist as .txt, .zip, or .tox (TouchDesigner)
- **Frontend UI:**
  - Playlist sidebar or modal for management
  - Add/remove selected clips to playlists
  - Drag-and-drop or up/down for ordering
  - Export/download and preview (play all/step-through)
- **Workflow:**
  - Add/remove multiple selected clips to playlists in one go
  - Show which playlists a clip belongs to in grid/detail views
  - Visual feedback: badges/highlights for playlist membership
- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests for all endpoints and ordering logic
  - UI tests for playlist creation, modification, and export

_Stretch:_ .tox export, multi-user/concurrent edits, creative integrations (TouchDesigner/Notch hooks).

## üöÄ UI & Layout Modernization (2024-06)
- The app now uses a robust flexbox layout: the playlist sidebar and grid never overlap, and the grid always fills the available space.
- Sidebar is persistent, modern, and ready for advanced playlist features (drag-and-drop, export, etc.).
- Responsive design: On mobile, the sidebar stacks on top; on desktop, it sits side-by-side with the grid.
- All layout is production-ready and tested for all screen sizes.
- The grid and sidebar are now ready for creative and advanced workflows.
