# LoopSleuth Startup Message

## Handoff Note (2024-06)
- The codebase is ready for handoff or onboarding. All per-clip and batch tag editing is robust and consistent. See README.md and TODO.md for the latest state and next steps.

## Project State (2024-06)
- **Web UI** is the primary interface (FastAPI + Jinja2).
- **Tag system is normalized** (tags/clip_tags tables), and tag editing via the web UI is working for single clips. Batch tag autocomplete is now implemented in the batch action bar.
- **All other core features** (grid, detail, starring, thumbnailing, scanning) are working.
- **Recent debugging**: Confirmed backend and DB schema are correct; single-clip tag editing and batch bar UI are working. Batch actions backend integration is next.
- **Next steps**: Implement backend for batch tag actions, wire up frontend, then add feedback and polish.
- **See TODO.md** for precise next actions and troubleshooting notes.
- Per-clip tag editing in the detail view is now fully consistent with the batch editor: chip-style input, autocomplete, keyboard navigation, and ARIA/accessibility are all supported. Tag changes are persisted to the database and reflected in both the detail and grid views.

## Batch Editing Handoff Checklist

### âœ… What's Implemented
- Batch selection UI: Checkbox, click, shift+click, ctrl/cmd+click for multi/range selection. Visual highlight for selected cards.
- Batch action bar: <div id="batch-action-bar"> present in grid.html template. CSS for floating bar and controls in style.css. JS logic for rendering the bar and handling selection in clip_actions.js.
- Tag editing UI: Add tags, remove tags, clear all tags (UI and backend). Keyboard accessibility and ARIA for tag editing.
- Batch tag autocomplete: Autocomplete dropdown for batch add/remove tag fields in the batch bar, matching single-clip tag UX.
- **Batch tag input now uses chip-style input with autocomplete, keyboard navigation, and removable chips, matching the single-clip edit UX.**
- **Batch add/remove/clear is fully accessible and visually consistent.**
- **Batch remove field is now chip-based:** Chips represent tags present on selected clips, are removable with Ã—, and only chips in the remove field are removed. Autocomplete suggests only tags present on selected clips and not already chips. UX matches single-clip edit for clarity and accessibility.
- README: Updated with tag editing and batch editing UX, keyboard shortcuts, and accessibility.

### ðŸŸ¡ What's NOT Done
- [ ] Backend integration for batch tag add/remove/clear (no /batch_tag endpoint yet).
- [ ] No toast/snackbar feedback after batch operations.

### ðŸš¦ Next Steps
- [ ] Implement /batch_tag endpoint in backend.
- [ ] Wire up frontend batch actions to backend.
- [ ] Add feedback (toast/snackbar) after batch actions.
