# LoopSleuth Startup Message

## Handoff & Path Forward (2024-06)
- Playlist badges in the detail view are now fully interactive and visually synced with the sidebar.
- Selecting a badge highlights it, selects and scrolls to the playlist in the sidebar, and provides immediate feedback.
- See the README for a full onboarding checklist and next steps for playlist/UX polish.

## Handoff Note (2024-06)
- **Production-ready:** Modern dark UI, batch selection/tagging, export (keepers.txt), and copy-to-folder for selected clips. Custom checkboxes, grid scroll restore, robust batch UX.
- **Next steps for dev:** Playlist management (create, name, reorder, export), advanced export (zip, .tox, etc.), further UX polish (keyboard shortcuts, accessibility, creative/visual features), gather user feedback and iterate.

## Project State (2024-06)
- **Web UI** is the primary interface (FastAPI + Jinja2).
- **Tag system is normalized** (tags/clip_tags tables), and tag editing via the web UI is working for single clips. Batch tag autocomplete is now implemented in the batch action bar.
- **All other core features** (grid, detail, starring, thumbnailing, scanning) are working.
- **Recent debugging**: Confirmed backend and DB schema are correct; single-clip tag editing and batch bar UI are working. Batch actions backend integration is next.
- **Next steps**: Implement backend for batch tag actions, wire up frontend, then add feedback and polish.
- **See TODO.md** for precise next actions and troubleshooting notes.
- Per-clip tag editing in the detail view is now fully consistent with the batch editor: chip-style input, autocomplete, keyboard navigation, and ARIA/accessibility are all supported. Tag changes are persisted to the database and reflected in both the detail and grid views.

## Preview Grid Overlay Improvements (2024-06)
- The Preview Grid overlay now uses a fully adaptive, responsive CSS Grid layout.
- Video player cells automatically adjust their size and aspect ratio based on the number of selected clips and the viewport size.
- Videos are maximized within their grid cells, maintaining aspect ratio and filling available vertical space.
- The grid uses `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(320px, 1fr))` for columns, and each cell/video fills the available height and width.
- The overlay is robust for 1 to many selected clips, and the code is modular and ready for further creative/UX enhancements.
- See `src/loopsleuth/web/static/clip_actions.js` for the JS logic and `grid.html` for the template.

## Batch Editing Handoff Checklist

### âœ… What's Implemented
- Batch selection UI: Checkbox, click, shift+click, ctrl/cmd+click for multi/range selection. Visual highlight for selected cards.
- Batch action bar: <div id="batch-action-bar"> present in grid.html template. CSS for floating bar and controls in style.css. JS logic for rendering the bar and handling selection in clip_actions.js.
- Tag editing UI: Add tags, remove tags, clear all tags (UI and backend). Keyboard accessibility and ARIA for tag editing.
- Batch tag autocomplete: Autocomplete dropdown for batch add/remove tag fields in the batch bar, matching single-clip tag UX.
- **Batch tag input now uses chip-style input with autocomplete, keyboard navigation, and removable chips, matching the single-clip edit UX.**
- **Batch add/remove/clear is fully accessible and visually consistent.**
- **Batch remove field is now chip-based:** Chips represent tags present on selected clips, are removable with Ã—, and only chips in the remove field are removed. Autocomplete suggests only tags present on selected clips and not already chips. UX matches single-clip edit for clarity and accessibility.
- README: Updated with tag editing and batch editing UX, keyboard shortcuts, and accessibility.

### ðŸŸ¡ What's NOT Done
- [ ] Backend integration for batch tag add/remove/clear (no /batch_tag endpoint yet).
- [ ] No toast/snackbar feedback after batch operations.

### ðŸš¦ Next Steps
- [ ] Implement /batch_tag endpoint in backend.
- [ ] Wire up frontend batch actions to backend.
- [ ] Add feedback (toast/snackbar) after batch actions.

### ðŸ“„ File Locations
- Grid template: src/loopsleuth/web/templates/grid.html
- Batch bar JS: src/loopsleuth/web/static/clip_actions.js
- Batch bar CSS: src/loopsleuth/web/static/style.css
- README: Project root

## How to Resume
- All recent fixes and context are documented in `TODO.md` and this message.
- To continue, start a new chat and reference this summary for seamless handoff.
- For any new features, review the last commits and TODOs for guidance.

## âœ… Batch Tag Editing: Production-Ready (2024-06)
- Batch tag add, remove, and clear actions are fully implemented and robust in both backend and frontend.
- The batch action bar UI is reliable, immediate, and accessible for all tag changes.
- Automated tests for batch tag actions are present and passing (see `tests/test_batch_tag.py`).
- The test suite uses a production-matching schema and covers all batch tag actions for multiple clips.
- The batch tag workflow is now fully production-ready and tested as of this commit.

## Video Preview Grid UI Exploration & Handoff (2024-06)

### Context
- The preview grid overlay was iteratively refined to maximize video preview size and maintain a professional, consistent layout.
- The goal was for each video preview to scale up in both width and height as the browser window grows, always maximizing the use of available space, while preserving aspect ratio and avoiding distortion or cropping.

### What Was Tried
- **Pure CSS Grid/Flexbox with object-fit: contain:**
  - Ensures videos are never cropped or distorted, but results in letterboxing/pillarboxing for non-16:9 content.
  - As the grid/cell gets wider, the height increases proportionally (with aspect-ratio), but only up to the limits of the grid and the number of columns.
- **object-fit: cover:**
  - Crops the video to always fill the cell, eliminating letterboxing, but at the cost of losing part of the image.
- **Dynamic aspect ratio per cell:**
  - Explored, but not implemented due to complexity and limited benefit for a grid of mixed aspect ratios.
- **Max-width and aspect-ratio constraints:**
  - Used to prevent cells from stretching excessively wide on large screens with few clips.

### Final Solution
- **Each cell uses a fixed 16:9 aspect ratio and a max width (800px).**
- **Grid uses auto-fit and minmax for responsive columns, centered content, and gap spacing.**
- **Videos use object-fit: contain, width: 100%, height: 100%.**
- This provides a robust, professional, and standards-compliant grid, matching the approach used by major video platforms.
- The grid is visually consistent, responsive, and works for any number of selected clips.

### Technical Constraints & Notes
- With a fixed aspect ratio, the cell's height always grows in proportion to its width. If the grid container is very wide and there are only a few items, the cells will get large, but always in proportion.
- There is no pure CSS/HTML solution to make every video fill both width and height of the overlay for arbitrary aspect ratios, without cropping or distorting the video.
- This is the same limitation and solution used by YouTube, Vimeo, and other professional video gallery UIs.

### Handoff
- The current implementation is robust, maintainable, and ready for further creative or advanced UX enhancements if desired.
- For single-video full-size preview, consider a modal overlay with dynamic aspect ratio.
- For creative/experimental layouts, consider custom canvas/WebGL or dynamic aspect ratio per cell (complex).
