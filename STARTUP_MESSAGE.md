# LoopSleuth - Startup Summary

Good morning! Here's where we left off:

**Last Actions:**
*   Implemented the `<Space>` key binding in the TUI to toggle the 'starred' status of the focused clip.
*   Updated the `TODO.md` to reflect this completion.
*   Removed a potentially problematic debug `self.log` call from the `ClipGrid.load_clips` method in `tui.py`.
*   Staged and committed all changes.

**Current Status:**
*   The core TUI functionality for browsing, starring, editing tags (`t`), deleting (`d`), and exporting (`e`) starred clips is implemented.
*   The dark mode toggle (`d` in TUI) is still potentially unstable due to issues likely related to the Textual version or environment; we reverted complex debugging attempts for stability.
*   Logging in the TUI is not working as expected (no `textual.log` file is being generated). This needs further investigation but was deferred.

**Next Steps (Suggestions based on TODO.md):**
1.  **Investigate TUI Logging:** Try to resolve why `textual.log` isn't being created. This is important for future debugging. Consider simpler logging methods or checking permissions/environment variables.
2.  **Near-Duplicate Detection:** Implement the logic to find and potentially flag near-duplicate clips based on the stored pHash values. This might involve adding a new view or command.
3.  **Refine Export:** Enhance the `export_starred_clips` function (e.g., allow choosing the output path, different formats).
4.  **Testing:** Add more robust tests, especially for the TUI interactions and database operations.
