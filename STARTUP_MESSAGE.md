# LoopSleuth Startup Message

## Project State (2024-06)
- **Web UI** is now the primary interface (FastAPI + Jinja2).
- **Grid and detail views**: Show all clips with thumbnails, video playback, starring, and tag editing.
- **AJAX tag editing**: Now reliable in both grid and detail views. Tags persist and are visible after edits.
- **/tag/{clip_id} endpoint**: Fixed to use a Pydantic model for JSON payloads, resolving 422 errors and ensuring tag persistence.
- **Media serving**: Thumbnails and videos are served via FastAPI routes for robust access.
- **Folder scan**: User can ingest new videos from any folder via the web UI.
- **All major changes are committed and documented.**

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add a "Clear Grid" or batch action option.
- [ ] Add advanced search/filtering and batch tagging.
- [ ] Add video format transcoding for browser compatibility (optional).
- [ ] Continue UI/UX polish and documentation.

## How to Resume
- All recent fixes and context are documented in `TODO.md` and this message.
